---

- [ ] If project files are locked and no one has them checked out in Unreal then run `p4 retype -t binary //DEPOT/...`.  This will unlock **ALL** the files in the repo

- [ ] If you cannot save a level while in Unreal run **Control Panel** and look for stray **Unreal** project files that are still around.
